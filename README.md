==================

I am working on a simple desktop application in java with SQL in the backend. It stores the registration details of a student and give him a unique ID. You can also allocate residence for a student and then send him an email regarding the details of his residence.
Requirements
You need to install SQL server.
If you want to view the project simply see final_jar.zip. Extract it. Run Jpro.jar.
Note: You need to make database first. Todo that simply execute data.sql file using any SQL query tool like MySQL Workbench.
